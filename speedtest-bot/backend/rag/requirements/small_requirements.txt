Introduction
The existing Custody and Securities system (CSS-HK) provides clients with local custody services, including execution of corporate actions, settlement and transactions etc. However, BOC realizes that many customers have global operations and require a more comprehensive solution to support their needs. The cash portfolio and fund management of asset management is a new function with the development of business in recent years. BOC needs a new system for helping them to provide global custody services as well as cash forecasting and cash analysis services with global operations. Therefore, a new Custody and Clearing Platform – Cloud (CSS-CL) is to be developed for supporting global cash flows management and cash forecasting of their clients. It can provide a more effective way to BOC clients for making financial decisions and manage their cash portfolios efficiently.

The system is expected to serve the custody account of external parties (i.e. BOCIPT). In Phase 1, only customers selected will receive CSS-CL Cash Management Services. At the initial stage, the system provides bank statement records, cash reconciliation reports, and cash overdue / projection reports, while customers will perform follow-up operations and daily cash operations.

In addition to the above, the system should also provide cash forecasts based on historical transactions and trends, allowing customers to predict future cash positions and make their decisions, while providing services in a simplified and user-friendly manner, becoming a comprehensive and complete Custody Management system.

The Clearing and Custody Platform – Cloud (CSS-CL) is designed to facilitate the cash management for the custody accounts. It helps to keep track of a series of processes and manage custody accounts in simplified way.
-	Maintain Client Account and Custody Account Information 
-	Automation of Bank Balance and Bank Transactions Uploading from BOC Core Bank System (CBL-HK)
-	Automation of Bank Balance and Bank Transaction Uploading from SWIFT  (RMC-HK)
-	Automation of Cash Transaction Uploading from CSS-HK
-	Automation of Cash Transaction Uploading from client via FTG-HK
-	Automation of Bank Book and Custodian Book Reconciliation 
-	Automation of Job Notification in Dashboard including Exception Reminder, Outstanding Task List or etc 
-	Provide the Projection Adjustment Function for adjust the status of overdue transactions
-	Generation of Client Cash Projection Report, Cash Management Report or etc

Maker-Approver Processing
Process Overview
The maintenance functions in the Custody and Clearing Platform - Cloud (CSS-CL) can be classified into two categories: -
1)	Single level maintenance
2)	2-level Marker-Approver maintenance

The records for the ‘Single Level Maintenance’ functions will be effective immediately after save and no approval action is required.  However, for the 2-level maker-approver maintenance functions, the record is treated as ‘Pending for approve’ after maker submission and senior user’s approval is necessary to make it effective.  

Maker-Approver (2-level) process is a kind of security checking. This process makes sure that information is approved by one/two parties before going to public within the organization. 

2-level process involves 2 different stages, Make and Approve. After creation, maker should submit the record for seeking the approval from approver. If the transaction amount does not reach the Dual Approval Limit defined in System Control Function, only one approver’s approval is needed. However, if the transaction amount reaches the Dual Approval Limit, dual approval procedure is required. It means two approver’s approval are needed. At the same time, approver need to type the transaction Currency and Amount in message box to ensure the amount has been verified. 

[Note : Maker, Approver(1) and Approver(2) must be different users.]  
带补充
Maintenance Status

For all Maker/Approver processing functions, a Maintenance Status will be kept with the following values:

Status	Description
Pending 	Record is still under maintenance and not yet submit for approval 
Pending for Approve
Maker submitted record for seeking approval 
Approved	Approved record
[Note : Record with Approved Status is the effective one] 
Rejected	Approver rejected the record to Maker for follow up


In Maker-Approver functions, the following buttons are provided. 


Case	Action User	Action Button	Description 
When Maker creates a new record OR modify an existing record 	Maker	Summary Screen  
		Add	Create a new record
		Edit	Amend the existing record
		Detail Screen
		Save 	Save Record but without submit the record for seeking approval
		Submit	Submit the record for approval
When approver approve/reject the record	Approver	Summary Screen
		Approve 	Approver can select multiple records and approve it at once
		Detail Screen
		View Original	View Original Record (i.e. the data Image before modification) 
		Approve 	Approve the record 
		Reject 	Rejected the record to Maker for follow up
When Maker follow up a rejected record	Maker	Summary Screen
		Edit 	Amend the rejected record
		Detail Screen
		Save	Save Record but without re-submit the record for seeking approval
		Submit	Re-submit the record for approval
		Withdraw	Withdraw the record 

When the record is saved, the Maintenance Status is defaulted as ‘Pending’.  When ‘Submit’ button is pressed, the maintenance status of the record will be changed from ‘Pending’ to ‘Pending for Approve’ (2-level).  At that time, the original record can no longer be retrieved using the Maintenance function. User is only allowed to view this original record information through ‘View Original’ button.  Instead, the approver can now retrieve the ‘Pending for Approve’ record to approve or reject the details using the corresponding Approval function from dashboard page.  If error is found, he/she can press ‘Reject’ button to change the status from ‘Pending for Approve’ to ‘Rejected’ so that the maker can amend the record using the maintenance function again. On the other hand, if there is no error found, the approver can press ‘Approve’ button to indicate the confirmation of approval process.  And then, the maintenance status will be changed from ‘Pending for Approval’ to ‘Approved’ which also confirm the effectiveness of the record. 

For detail 2-level Maker-Approver processing function list, please refer to Chapter 2.3 Function Inventory

Description:	The dashboard provides the entire picture of the account for which the user is responsible. All transactions that need to be processed will be displayed on the dashboard, including resolved issues, and pending issues, providing an easy-to-use way to monitor and track the completion of daily tasks. With the help of the dashboard, users can smoothly understand the list of tasks they need to work on, which ensures that the team is organized and focused on their responsibilities.

The following is the information displayed on the dashboard:
(1)	Exception Issues for follow up or issues need to be alerted (i.e. Bank Statement Missed, Cash Transaction File Missed, Reconciliation Failed) 
(2)	Maker-Approver Processing Task 

Automation of Tasks Generation 
All tasks in dashboard are automatically generated from the system. The system divides all notifications into four categories, and the related classification and processing are as follows. 
(1)	Maker-Approver Processing Task (Pending for Approve)
(a)	Approver - Any user with corresponding approver right can process the ‘Pending for approve’ record. Approver can verify the records and decide to approve/reject it. It will show the pending for approve record with the changes highlighted in yellow by default, approver can press the “View Original” button to view the original record and revert back for comparison. 
(2)	Maker - Any user with corresponding Add/Edit (maker) right can view the “Pending for approve” record so that maker can know the latest status. When the user double-clicks the record, CSS-CL will auto-navigate it to enquiry mode for user to view the record. Maker-Approver Processing Task (Rejected)
All rejected records will be shown on the dashboard. Any user with corresponding maker/approver right can view the rejected record.
(a)	Maker – any user with corresponding Add/Edit (maker) right can  double-clicks the rejected record (not just the maker who submitted the record initially), CSS-CL will auto-navigate it to maintenance mode for user to modify the record and re-submit it for seeking approval again. It shows last Maker & last Approver’s comments and previous ‘Pending for approve’ record, the previous changes that has been made will be highlighted in Yellow and maker can choose 1) further revise the record / temporarily save the current work and submit for approval again OR 2) press “Withdraw”, then the ‘Pending for approve’ record will be discarded and the record will keep as original and remain unchanged.
(b)	Approver - When the user double-clicks the rejected record, CSS-CL will auto-navigate it to enquiry mode for user to view the record again. 
(3)	Maker-Approver Processing Task (Approved)
All approved records in current processing date will be shown on the dashboard for user reference. Any user with corresponding maker/approver right can view the approved record. After the day, CSS-CL will auto-remove the records which were approved in the current processing date from dashboard. 
(a)	Any user with the corresponding Enquiry right cannot view the category list on the left-hand side of the dashboard. 
(4)	Exception 
(a)	When the CUTOFF time of Bank Statement is up but the system finds that CBS/SWIFT has not been received on time, CSS-CL will auto-generate an exception message into dashboard. Any user with the access right of ‘Bank Statement Reconciliation Overview’ function can view the exceptional record. When the user double-clicks this exception record, CSS-CL will auto-navigate user to ‘Bank Statement Reconciliation Overview’ function for follow up. For detail exception handling, please refer to Chapter 3.2.1 Bank Statement Reconciliation Overview. 

SWIFT: If the bank statement is missing due to it is in holiday, CTS user should update the corresponding holiday record and press “Resume” for the corresponding SWIFT message in Incoming SWIFT Enquiry, then system will rerun the bank statement checking and the exception record in dashboard will be dismissed ? marked as Completed? 

CBL & SWIFT: as CTS user is not supposed to adjust the record in system date maintenance or if external assigned bank is unable to provide bank statement on a working date due to special circumstance: 
1)	Without transaction: in this case, the impact is minor, as the opening balance of next day is correct and there is no impact to the cash statement file provided on T and the reconciliation process of T+1.
2)	With transaction: in this case, the opening balance of T+1 (custodian book) will be incorrect, CTS user can manual adjust the balance of custodian book by inserting (= upload file) a dummy cash transaction entry, to minimize the impact of cash projection.

Note: this is a rare case. And the background process job: CBL file and SWIFT message job: support backdate 


(a)	When the CUTOFF time of Cash Transaction File is up but the system finds that file has not been received on time or received the file with exception?, CSS-CL will auto-generate an exception message into dashboard. Any user with access right of the ‘Cash Transaction File Upload Status’ function can view the exception record. When the user double-clicks this exception record, CSS-CL will auto-navigate user to ‘Cash Transaction File Upload Status’ function for follow up. For detail exception handling, please refer to Chapter 3.2.2 Cash Transaction File Upload Status. 

Note: Count blank file

(b)	After receive the Bank Statement and all Cash Transaction Files, CSS-CL will reconcile the Internal Cash Account and Shadow Cash Account immediately. Any failure was found, CSS-CL will auto-generate an exception message into dashboard. Any user with the access right of ‘Bank Statement Reconciliation Overview’ function can view the exception record. When the user double-clicks this exception record, CSS-CL will auto-navigate user to ‘Bank Statement Reconciliation Overview’ function for follow up. For detail exception handling, please refer to Chapter 3.2.1 Bank Statement Reconciliation Overview. 

Locked by / Completed Action 
(1)	Record is being modified by another user
(2)	Record has been modified/approved by another user 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for illustrate the 
(1)	User A, B: Client Maint. - Maker
(2)	User C1, C2: Client Maint. – Checker
(3)	User D: Client Maint. – Enquiry

Assume: User A – D don’t have any access permission for non-Client function group

Dashboard: User A new / update / delete a client record and submit, then: 
Item\ User	Client Maint. – Maker	Client Maint. – Checker (C1)	Client Maint – Checker (User C2)	Client Maint. – Enquiry
Pending Approval – Single Approval
(Client Maint.)	Y, read only	Y, approve	Y, approve	N 
Pending Approval – Dual Approval and C1 approved it before 
(Client Maint.)	Y, read only	Y, read only	Y, approve	N
Pending Approval
(non-Client Maint.)	N	N	N	N
Rejected = pending resubmit
(Client Maint.)	Y, edit	Y, read only	Y, ready only	N
Rejected = pending resubmit
(non-Client Maint.)	N	N	N	N
Approved = completed
(Client Maint.)	Y, read only	Y, read only	Y, ready only	N
Approved = completed
(non-Client Maint.)	N	N	N	N
Note: N means the function on the category list (left-hand side) of dashboard page will not be appeared.  

Below applies to all record in dashboard and all edit buttons in function page: 
Maker: 
(1)	Once a user (User A / C1) clicks the record for edit / approval, the record will be locked and if another user (User B / C2) attempts to click the record for edit / approval (allow to read only), a warning message will be prompted “This record is locked by <User ID>, <User Name>”. This applies to all records in dashboard and all edit buttons in function page. 
(2)	This record will be released only if the user (User A / C1) clicks “exit” to the record or the session of the user (User A / C1) is time-out. 
(3)	Locking Handling 
(a)	If User A press “Exit” without changes / without save: 
After the record is unlocked, another user (User B) can pick up the record. 
(b)	If User A press “Save” before exit:
